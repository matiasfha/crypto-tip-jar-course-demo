## üöå Getting starting with Ethereum Development

- [Demo app can be found here](https://crypto-tip-jar-course-demo.vercel.app/)

In this coures you'll learn about the many moving parts required to start building a full stack (descentralized) application based on the Ethereum network. How to write an smart contract, write tests and how to interact with it through a web application.

Lastly, you'll learn how to deploy your dapp to the blockchain.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Course summary

Ok. Are you ready? Cool, this will be quite a journey but fun and full of challenges. A few this that you'll be able to learn.

- How to setup SvelteKit.
- How write an smart contract with Solidity.
- How to configure an Ethereum development environment.
- How to test an smart contract using javascript.
- How to connect a web application to a wallet.
- How to interact with a deployed smart contract.
- How to deploy an smart contract.

## üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªWho Am I?

üëã I [Mat√≠as Hern√°ndez](https://matiashernandez.dev), father, developer, podcaster, writer and instructor.

I started my journey many years ago (even before jQuery became a thing), though this years I tried many different things but web developmet has always been my passion. During the last 10 years I officialy worked as "Softare Engineer" or "Developer" (the role name depends on the company ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) for many different projects. During this years I collected ideas, concepts and knowledge that I try to share in different mediums to help other developers to level up their careers.

I love what I do and I try to bring the same passion to the content creation trough courses at [egghead.io](https://matiasfha.dev/egghead), articles en [FreeCodeCamp](https://matiasfha.dev/fcces), [my blog](https://matiashernandez.dev), [Cloudinary](https://mediajams.dev/author/matias-hernandez) and other publicationss and also with my podcasts [Caf√© con Tech](https://www.cafecon.tech/) & [Control Remoto](https://www.controlremoto.io/) and finally thorugh my [newsletter](https://microbytes.dev).

## ‚è∞ Before the course

The main requisits to start with ethereum development is an "intermediate" knowledege on javascript and web development in general, the idea is to bring you into this new and excinting world from scratch!

### üõ† Requirements

This are the things you need to susccessfully go through this course

#### Sytem Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.13 or above
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) `12 || 14 || 15 || 16`
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6 or superior
- Install [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (this will also be done through the course )

This tools need to be part of your system, you can check each version in the terminal

```shell
$ git --version
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

#### Configuration

> If you like, you can fork this repository so you can store your progress.

- [ ] Clonse the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/matiasfha/crypto-tip-jar-course-demo
```

- [ ] Install the dependencies

```shell
cd crypto-tip-jar-course-demo
npm install
```

> this can take a few minutes

If you have any problem during this process, please [fille an issue](https://github.com/matiasfha/crypto-tip-jar-course-demo/issues/new).

#### Execute the project

The `main` branch hold the final project ready to be tested, if you want to run locally to check what you'll build you can do it by

```shell
npm run start
```

This will:

- spawn a local ethereum network
- compile and locally deploy the smart contract
- Run the contract tests
- run the web application and open your browser

> Now you just need to import an account into metamask to test the application locally
> This will be shown through the course

### ‚ùì How to run each lesson

Each video lesson have a companion code that you'll be able to find in a corresponding branch named as `lesson-XX`.

You can navigate through the branches to review the resulting code to follow the video lesson.

## üìù About the course

### Lessons structure

Each lesson will show you a little step towards the en goals. Also each lesson have it's own branch and it's own Readme file that will give you some resources and written content related with the video lesson.
