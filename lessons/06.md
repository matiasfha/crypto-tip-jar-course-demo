# Metamask

To send transactions to the smart contract, we will need to connect a wallet, for this purposes we'll use Metamask with one of the test accounts

[Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) helps to handle account management and connecting the current user to the blockchain. MetaMask enables users to manage their accounts and keys in a few different ways while isolating them from the site context.

Once a user has connected their MetaMask wallet, you as a developer can interact with the globally available Ethereum API (`window.ethereum`) that identifies the users of web3-compatible browsers (like MetaMask users), and whenever you request a transaction signature, MetaMask will prompt the user in as comprehensible a way as possible.
