# Lesson 05

# The deploy script

To deploy the contract we need a script that take cares of the process using hardhat ethers.

```javascript
const main = async () => {
	const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
	const accountBalance = await deployer.getBalance();

	console.log('Deploying contracts with account: ', deployer.address);
	console.log('Account balance: ', accountBalance.toString());

	const Token = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('TipJar');
	const portal = await Token.deploy();
	await portal.deployed();
	console.log('TipJar address: ', portal.address);
};

const runMain = async () => {
	try {
		await main();
		process.exit(0);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
		process.exit(1);
	}
};

runMain();
```

With this in hand we can test the deploy process to the local network

Let's ramp up a local ethereum network using hardhat

`npm run hardhat node` this will show in the console a set of accounts and private keys that can be used for testing purrposes.

These are 20 test accounts and addresses created for us that we can use to deploy and test our smart contracts. Each account is also loaded up with 10,000 fake Ether. I

This account can be imported to the wallet of choice so you can test locally

# Deploy

Once this script is executed, the smart contract should be deployed to the local test network and we should be then able to start interacting with it.

> When the contract was deployed, it used the first account that was created when we started the local network.

If you look at the output from the CLI, you should be able to see something like this:

`TipJar address:`

This address is what we will use in our client application to talk to the smart contract. Keep this address available as we will need to use it when connecting to it from the client application.
